# kochab-server-side-monsters
Just like lecture today. Create a new project from the ground up for monsters. Create a monster array on the server. The get request /monsters should send the array to the client side.

[ 'Big Foot', 'Loch Ness Monster', 'Mike', 'Sully' ]

On the client side, display all of the monsters on localhost:5000 in an unordered list. You will need an index.html and client.js file in your public folder in order for this to work.
